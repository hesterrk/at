This is a [`React.js`] project created with [`vite.js`](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

## Getting Started

First, run npm install and then start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

Open the local network that instructs you in the terminal.

## Description of approach in task:

1. I chose to use react as I am most comfortable with this library and it would mean a quick development time. I also chose to use Javascript (instead of typescript, which I have been using recently) as it was a small project.

2. I created the components folder for the pieces of reusable code that could be used if this project was extended and a singular home page for the view.

3. I chose to use CSS modules to scope the styles locally to the components and page

4. I created the components first - footer and the navbar and then created the rest of the home page.

5. For the image on the page, I went to a placeholder image website to generate it
